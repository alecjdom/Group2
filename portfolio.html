        <p style="color: aquamarine;">I am a student within the B.Arch program at NJIT.<br>
             I set out to begin my journey as an undergraduate architecture student in order to develop my future career and passions.<br>
             My love of creating will carry over into the studio at NJIT, along with my hard work ethic and focus.</p>
